            Designing a new portfolio is easy. Committing your time and following through with that original concept, that's the tricky part.

            I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2011. I haven't been working on this update for two years, but I have been coming back to it ever few months. It's undergone <a style="color: #4AB19A;" href="https://dribbble.com/shots/884529-develop-design">countless iterations</a> .

        </p>

            Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change its game (think responsive design). This was more down to me taking my sweet time more than anything else.

        </p>
        <p class="para">Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a new portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing / coding elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some flourishes in the coming weeks and months (I've been toying with <a  style="color: #4AB19A;" href="http://snapsvg.io/">snap svg</a> which I'm looking forward to integrating).

        </p>

            In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while building out this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution. Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with building their first portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!
